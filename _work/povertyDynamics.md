abstract: 'This paper uses the 1996-2001 National Socioeconomic Survey panel
database to analyze poverty dynamics in Chile, drawing a distinction between
chronic and transient poverty. We found that while 20 per cent of the population
was living below the official poverty line both in 1996 and 2001, only 9 per cent of
the population was poor at both dates. We also found that when the poverty line was
raised, the amount of households which could be considered chronically poor rose
steadily, whereas the transitory component of poverty remained more or less stable.
Analysis of the direct reasons for changes in household poverty status leads us to the
conclusion that labour dynamics are far more relevant than demographic changes.
Household heads who suffered health problems are significantly less likely to leave
poverty. Household human and physical capital are also relevant, as well as the
sector in which the household head works. Simulating this exercise using different
poverty lines reveals that some variables are not robust to changes in the definition
of poverty, while others which originally appeared to be insignificant become so for
most other possible poverty lines.'
