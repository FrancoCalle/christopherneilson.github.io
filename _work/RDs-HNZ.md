abstract: 'This paper studies how the choice of college and major are related to life cycle
earnings in a context where selection bias can potentially confound direct measurement.
Three decades of ranked college applications and assignment data for the
population of college students in Chile are linked to a decade of administrative tax
data on earnings which allow for the study of student choices, college and major
affect earnings. Application behavior, OLS earnings regressions and thousands of
different RD earnings estimates are tied together using a parsimonious model of
college major choice and earnings determination. After considering for the presence
of selection bias, results stemming from the analysis suggest that there is
considerable heterogeneity that is predictable across options. This heterogeneity
can be explained by a combination of course content and observable comparative
advantage given by interactions of major characteristics and student skills. '
