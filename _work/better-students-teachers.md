abstract: "In this paper we document the effects of incentives aimed at shifting high achieving
students into the teaching profession in Chile. The education system in Chile has
recently resolved issues associated with coverage of schooling and has been transiting
towards focusing on problems associated with the quality and equity of education
provision, where teacher quality has been a major focus. The government of Chile
implemented a policy in 2010 that gave full scholarships and other incentives such as
stipends and travel for students who matriculate at teaching colleges with scores from
the highest 30% of the admissions test distribution. Colleges however needed to implement
a cutoff score of the 50th percentile if they were to be eligible. The results
of this ”carrots and sticks” policy was that the proportion of high achieving students
rose by approximately 50%, although enrollment from the lower end of the distribution
continued high at non participating institutions. Using a regression discontinuity
empirical design it is shown that the probability of choosing the teaching profession
rose by 40% to 200% at different point of the distribution. The effects were found to
be greater for students who were male and who came from public schools or families
with lower income levels."
