abstract: 'The recent literature on sudden stops is based on the fact that many emerging market economies
experience recurrent and sharp capital account reversals. In this paper we argue, as some recent
research has started to emphasize, that more information can be obtained by looking at gross rather
than net flows. Economies may be curtailed from international financial markets, resulting in a sudden
stop of inflows, but others may be experiencing portfolio shifts that cause sudden start of capital
outflows. By looking at gross flows, and comparing emerging markets (EMEs) with developed
economies (DEs) we indeed show that there is a variety of experiences that cannot be lumped together.
In particular, sudden stop of inflows are as common in DEs as in EMEs, but a key difference is that in
the former outflows and inflows are negatively correlated, which dampen the reversal of net flows. We
present a model of financial diversification to interpret these results which is consistent with most
evidence we report here. '
