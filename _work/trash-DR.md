abstract: 'This is a collaborative project with the City government of Santo Domingo to design and evaluate different interventions to improve payment compliance for public garbage collection. In a first stage, we will analyze data on payment histories, as well as undertake targeted interviews and focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of payment compliance. In the second stage, we will design and implement several randomized control trials to evaluate different behavioral and non-behavioral approaches to reduce free-riding. The interventions considered are: 1) Informing households about the consequences on their credit history of not paying the bill; 2) A lottery for households with timely payments; 3) Informing households of residential buildings that their building has a debt, 4) Informing citizens about actual compliance rates in high compliance neighborhoods. This will shed light on how to address free-riding and how to improve a state’s capacity to effectively collect payments for government services. This project is funded by J-PAL’s Government Initiative.'
